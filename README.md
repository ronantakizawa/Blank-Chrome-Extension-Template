This is a blank template for building chrome extensions. For beginners, ignore all files except the popup.html, where you can focus on writing html and css. 

How to deploy your chrome extension:
1. Type "chrome://extensions/" into your search tab. It should show all of your chrome extensions. 
2. Turn on developer mode. 
3. Click "load unpacked" and select this file. 
4. Your chrome extension should be live!
