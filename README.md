This chrome extension calculates the watts used from your laptop by tracking the battery percentage. Using the watts, a user's carbon footprint can be calculated. The average laptop has around 110 watts that can be used (https://www.mtech.news/article/MacBook-Pro-2021-M1-Max-Power-Consumption-Low-And-High-Power-Mode-175284), and each watt contributes to approximately 0.385g of CO2 emitted.
